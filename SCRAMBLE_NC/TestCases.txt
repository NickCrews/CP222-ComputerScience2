Case:
A blank String is entered.

Result:
Nothing is printed out. (Which makes sense, there are no permutations of a blank string). The factorial method gives the wrong answer, but that's fine since it is irrelevant


Case:
A String with length one is entered

Result:
The only permutation of the original String is given, which is what you would expect.


Case:
A string with 2 or more characters is entered, the String may have repeating characters, such as "BEEN".

Result:
Acts as you would expected. Permutations will be repeated, ie BEEN will be printed twice


Case:
Non-alphabetic characters are entered

Result:
They are used normally
