Pick a program from Final Programs and check with me.  Note that the programs are grouped according to how difficult I perceive them to be.  Group 1 should be the easiest and Group 3 the hardest.  You can pick from any group or come up with your own, but I would like final say.  Grading will also be weighted slightly to account for the program difficulty.  Be prepared to share your program with the class on the last two days of the course.

Name your folder FINAL with your initials.
